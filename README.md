‚ùìHOW TO BURN TOKENS‚ùì

Each token has a burning system in its contract every time you trade them. 3% will be burned (killed) and 7% will be distributed to everyone that holds that token. 

üë®üèª‚Äçüè´Example:üë®üèª‚Äçüè´ 
Human A buys 100'000 $KOVID tokens.
‚Äî‚Äî 3% are burned -> 3'000 tokens
‚Äî‚Äî 7% are distributed to every $KOVID holder -> 7'000 tokens

_________________________________________________________

‚ùìWhy would I buy $KOVID tokens‚ùì
Everytime you buy tokens, you burn a certain amount (3%) of $KOVID. This helps the entire community to complete quests. Also, holding $KOVID means that every user that trades $KOVID sends you 7% of the tokens he bought (+to all the $KOVID holders).

‚ùìHow do we know which quest we have to do ?‚ùì
A new quest will be generated each time that the community completes the ongoing quest. The new quest will be then pinned so everyone can see it.
